# Solidity Smart Contracts

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain development. Solidity is a programming language used for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Structure

- **contracts**: This directory houses the Solidity smart contracts.
- **tests**: Unit tests for the smart contracts using tools like Truffle or Hardhat.
- **scripts**: Additional scripts, deployment or migration scripts.
- **build**: Compiled contract artifacts generated during the compilation process.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Compile smart contracts: `npx hardhat compile`.
4. Run tests: `npx hardhat test`.
5. Deploy contracts: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`.
